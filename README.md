# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work.

- I was motivated to create this project to learn the basics of HTML, CCS and Javascript before starting the online bootcamp
- The reason behind this project is to allow me to review notes and create a website to furture my knowledge and confidence that this can be done.
- While creating this project, I ran through many different challenges that I was able to navigate to further my knowledge and troubleshoot.
- I learned that I will need to focus my efforts and discipline myself to know that mistakes will be made and follow through with researching and applying solutions.
