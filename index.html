        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Sematic elements make the HTML easier to read by other developers</li>
          <li>There are opening tags and closing tags to allow the browser to understand how to treat the content.</li>
          <li>Elements are the entire sections and tags are the content inside the sections</li>
          <li>Headers need to be numbered in order in each section to keep them in the correct placement</li>
          <li>Parent elements hold all the child elements for example: Main "Parent Element" Holds h2, ul, li "Child Elements"</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage, inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS, is when style an element directly into the html file.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for a webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External style sheet is most common, which allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a seperate file.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet you will need to "link" in the "head" of the html file.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components, property and value of that property. Such as color:blue.</li>
          <li>Margin(property) is the space outside of the element, while Padding(property) is the space inside the element. Each will need a value.</li>
